1. This is good use of object oriented design because this program takes into account parent and child processes and does a read and write.

2. One way would be to include different case statements to filter the different outputs.

3. It is possible that another case would be put to to ensure that the child terminates only when the parents suggests it. Also if the process value is stored into a temporary string and then read by the parent, this would allow for the data to be preserved.
